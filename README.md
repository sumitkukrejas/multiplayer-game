# Online multiplayer game using webSockets

## About this project
- This is an online multi-player game similar to Agar.io.
- Build with vanilla javascript to get the taste of how things were done in the old times without frameworks like react.
- Using Express for the backend servers to bring down the complexity and player-server connectivity is handled using Socket.io. 
- The site is live and the website link is in the description of this repo, site will be deployed until the free tier runs out, so check it out.
