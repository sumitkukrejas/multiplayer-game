This is an online multi-player game similar to Agar.io, build with vanilla javascript to get the taste of how things were done in the old times without frameworks like react.
Using Express for the backend servers to bring down the complexity and player-server connectivity is handled using Socket.io (WebSockets). The site is live and the website link 
is in the description of this repo, site will be deployed until the free tier runs out, so check it out.
